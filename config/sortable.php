    | Here you may specify a mapping of model aliases to their fully qualified
    | class names. This is useful when you want to use short names in your
    | routes or when your models are located outside of App\Models.
    |
    | Example:
    | 'models' => [
    |     'post' => App\Models\Post::class,
    |     'user' => App\Entities\User::class,
    | ],
    |
    */
    'models' => [],
];
